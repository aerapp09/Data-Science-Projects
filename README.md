# Welcome to my Data-Science-Projects
## A repository for my Data Science Projects
This is a repository for data analysis, machine learning and visualization in R, Python, and Jupyter notebook. It contains many useful projects including:
1. Statistical analysis:
   - The classic Titanic dataset (machine learning in R) make conclusions about demographics and predict survival using Random Forest.
   - Financial conclusions of the diamond trade (python in jupyter) which cut is most popular? 
   - Housing in Francisco. How does proximity to the ocean affect house prices? Report in PowerBi

2.  I created 4 shiny apps that let the user change the data and see it reflected in a visual.
      - Compare the census demographics based on race for the U.S.
      - Compare Iris petal length and width, and see how this simple aspect can be used for machine learning

3.  Machine learning using the data sets already mentioned to make predictions based on given variables.

## This repository has several uses:
- See a few ways I cleaned and munged data in R and Python. [link](\my_R_Projects)
- Learn about the various packages and uses between the two [link](\myJupyterNotebooks)
- For example Matplotlib's extensive use in Python and Shiny apps in R.
- Learn about how to do statistical analysis [link](\myJupyterNotebooks)
- Learn how to create apps in Shiny [link](\my_R_Projects\Shiny_projects)

## How Users can get started with the project
1. Clone the repository. Click [repository home page](https://github.com/aerapp09/Data-Science-Projects) 'Repository Home')
2. Click the green "Code" button. You have the option of downloading the Zip or use the Github app. 

3. Once downloaded. Unzip the file so it is in a folder on your computer.
   
4. Click on the folder for one of the applications.
   
5. A good starting point is one of the ipynb files, which you can see here:[Using Python to analyize the diamond market (/myJupyterNotebooks/MultivariateAnalysis_diamonds.ipynb)

6. Double click on the MultivariateAnalysis_diamonds.ipynb file in the Tictactoe folder and open with a browser.
