# Welcome to my Data-Science-Projects
## A repository for my Data Science Projects
This is a repository for my projects coded in R, Python, and Jupyter notebook. It contains many useful projects including:
1. Statistical analysis of many datasets.
   - Examples include the classic Titanic dataset where data about the survivors of the titanic disaster can be used to make graph and discover conclusions about demographics.
   - Financial conclusions of the diamond trade. I analyze the aspects of the diamond market see for example what 'cut' has is the most popular.
   - Housing data of San Francisco. How does proximity to the ocean affect house prices? That and more in this dataset

2.  I created 4 shiny apps that let the user change the data and see it reflected in a visual.
      - Compare the census demographics based on race for the U.S.
      - Compare Iris petal length and width, and see how this simple aspect can be used for machine learning

3.  Machine learning using the data sets already mentioned to make predictions based on given variables.

## This repository has several uses:
- See a few ways I cleaned and munged data in R and Python. [link](\myJupyterNotebooks and \my_R_Projects)
- Learn about the various packages and uses between the two [link](\myJupyterNotebooks and \my_R_Projects)
- For example Matplotlib's extensive use in Python and Shiny apps in R.
- Learn about how to do statistical analysis [link](\myJupyterNotebooks)
- Learn how to create apps in Shiny [link](\my_R_Projects\Shiny_projects)

## How Users can get started with the project
1. Clone the repository. Click [repository home page](https://github.com/aerapp09/Data-Science-Projects) 'Repository Home')
2. Click the green "Code" button. You have the option of downloading the Zip or use the Github app. 

3. Once downloaded. Unzip the file so it is in a folder on your computer.
   
4. Click on the folder for one of the applications.
   
5. A good starting point is one of the ipynb files, which you can see here:[Using Python to analyize the diamond market (/myJupyterNotebooks/MultivariateAnalysis_diamonds.ipynb)

6. Double click on the MultivariateAnalysis_diamonds.ipynb file in the Tictactoe folder and open with a browser.
