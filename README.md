# Welcome to my Data-Science-Projects
## A repository for my Data Science Projects

## This is a repository for projects coded in R, Python, and Jupyter notebook.

## This repository has several uses:
    -See a few ways I cleaned and munged data in R and Python. (\myJupyterNotebooks and \my_R_Projects)
    -Learn about the various packages and uses between the two (\myJupyterNotebooks and \my_R_Projects)
        +For example Matplotlib's extensive use in Python and Shiny apps in R.
    -Learn about how to do statistical analysis (\myJupyterNotebooks)
    -Learn how to create apps in Shiny (\my_R_Projects\Shiny_projects)
