## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris)
```
```{r }
x <- 1:10
y <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)
df <- data.frame(x, y)
df
```
###I made sure to r include=FALSE so there is no display of code for this color plot
```{r include= FALSE}
colorFunc <- 'heat.colors'
```
```{r fig.cap='The Maunga Whau volcano', echo= FALSE}
image(volcano, col=get(colorFunc)(200))
```

Have to install reticulate to use python
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```




## Python
```{python}
for i in range(5):
  print('hello, jello')
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(marmap)
library(ggplot2)
```

The [marmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/index.html) package provides tools and data for visualizing the ocean floor. Here is an example contour plot of marmap's ``r params$data`` dataset.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data(list = params$data)
autoplot.bathy(get(params$data))
```
