several packages support making beautiful tables with R such as

* [xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/)
* [stargazer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/)
* [pander](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/)
* [tables](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/)
* [ascii](http://eusebe.github.io/ascii/)
* etc.

It is also very easy to make tables with knitr's 'kable' function:

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5, ], caption= 'A knitr kable.')
```
